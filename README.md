### Resampling & Spatiotemporal Approaches

Our implementation largely relies on resampling and spatial & temporal techniques.

...

### Direct Illumination

#### G-Buffer

All our ReSTIR and denoising process later require screen space geometry information, so we need to generate G-Buffer. By this time, our G-Buffer is generated along with ray tracing. Here is our G-Buffer layout (we will illustrate this later):

- Depth: float
- Normal: vec3
- Albedo: vec3
- Mat ID: uint
- Material (metallic, roughness, transmission & ior): vec4
- Motion vector: ivec2

To save memory and reduce bandwidth occupancy, our G-Buffer components are compressed with different techniques. After compression, our G-Buffer looks like this:

- Depth: 4 bytes
- Normal: 4 bytes
- Albedo: 3 bytes
- Hashed Mat ID: 1 byte
- Material: 4 bytes
- Motion vector: 4 bytes

Which saves 56 - 20 = 36 bytes per pixel.

#### Direct ReSTIR

We implemented ReSTIR DI [[B. Benedikt et al., SIG 2020]]() for our direct illumination. However, different from the original paper, we did several modifications to make it more suitable for real-time path tracing:

- First, we observed that, to maintain a relatively temporally stable output from ReSTIR, the number of RIS samples we sample in each ray tracing pass does not have to be very large (e.g., M = 32 in the paper). M = 4 is enough.
- Second, for reservoir clamping, we clamped the M of valid temporally neighboring reservoir to about 80x of current ones. This helps our direct illumination to quickly adapt to updated camera perspectives while keeping stable.
- Last, we didn't use spatial resampling in our implementation, though we have it as an option in our code. This is because spatial resampling is time consuming. And our implementation of spatial resampling doesn't produce much improvement. So instead, we tried to use a spatial filter to remove noise.

### Indirect Illumination

#### Indirect ReSTIR

For indirect illumination, we implemented ReSTIR GI [[S. Ouyang et al., HPG 2021]](). Similar to DI, we did not use spatial resampling.

...

#### Reduced Resolution & Block-wise Long Paths

Based on the nature of tracing longer paths and perform more occlusion tests, we observed that tracing indirect lighting is much slower than direct. For example, before we optimized indirect lighting, running the Bistro Exterior scene takes 3.9 ms for direct and 25 ms for indirect.

Wasting time on tracing relatively insignificant component is not effective. Usually the variation of indirect illumination is at lower frequency based on the assumption that most surfaces in a scene are diffuse. With not so sharp variation, we could possibly trace less rays and use interpolation to reconstruct indirect illumination. In our path tracer, we reduce the resolution for indirect lighting to 1/4 of direct lighting and then do "fake" upscaling to produce a full resolution image. The approach we use is blending neighboring pixels, but not as far as bilinear filtering, which we believe could preserve some sharp  details on edges.

Besides, we did as suggested in the ReSTIR GI paper, that to decide whether to trace longer paths with Russian roulette on a block level. We only allow 25% of rays to trace multiple bounces, while the rest 75% trace one bounce.

### Denoising

#### A Lightweight Edge-Avoiding A-Trous Filter

In both ReSTIR DI and GI we have already included reuse of temporally neighboring samples, which gives us pretty decent temporally stable results. Therefore when it comes to denoising, we don't necessarily need a spatiotemporal denoiser like SVGF, not to say that temporally reused outputs from ReSTIR are correlated and prone to artifacts if denoised temporally.

Just like what we did in project 4, our denoising process is logically divided into three stages: demodulation, filtering and remodulation. We let the output from ReSTIR to be divided by screen-space albedo (trick by setting materials' base color to 1), and do tone mapping to compress radiance values into a range that denoiser can handle well.

The direct and indirect components are filtered separately and merged after filtering. For direct we use a 4-level wavelet filter since it's already smooth. For indirect, we use a 6-level wavelet to reduce flickering.
